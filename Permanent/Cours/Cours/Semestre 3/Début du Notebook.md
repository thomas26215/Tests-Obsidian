I'm a sophomore student, undergraduate at the University Institute of Technology 2 (IUT2) in Grenoble. We have a lot of lectures, which serves us to understand the theory about what we do, but also tutorials to put into practice what we learned in lectures.
We have a lot of major courses, such as programming (where we study various programming languages) or networking, but we also have many minor courses that are equally important, such as economics,  communication or English.
To finish this paragraph, I'll speak about my childhood : I studied in a middle school in Montelimar, called Marguerite Duras ; Next, I studied in the high school called LPO Les Catalins, in the same city, which focuses on scientific studies. I also obtained my A-level with honours.

I began to learn about programming when I was 12. Yes, I was young. I started in middle school using Scratch, a website that teaches you to code with blocks. I discovered this website by looking at other people using it. I developed many projects such as a 2D Minecraft and a lot of other games. By the way, I tried to recreate one of them using Unity2D with C#, and it's much more complicated. Then I discovered what real programming is at the end of middle school with Python, and I really loved it. It was a very satisfying thing to write lines of code to create what I wanted. It was so much fun!

I discovered this language with the website France-IOI, which is a platform that teaches you how to code and gives you challenges and exercises to practice. In my last year of high school, I began to learn Java as an autodidact because I wanted to create a mobile application, and it was so motivating : I scheduled 30 minutes every day without missing a single day ! Some days I even coded for hours.

Today, I am in a BUT Informatique program, and I have improved my skills in my favorite languages such as Java, SQL, and Web development. I have also learned many new things like C, Communication, Project management, and other skills.

I feel closest to the Belbin Team Roles of Specialist and Implementer.

As a Specialist, I have a deep passion for programming and constantly strive to deepen my technical knowledge. For instance, I've taught myself several programming languages, such as Java for mobile app development, and regularly dedicate time to improving my skills.

My Resource Investigator traits come into play as I leverage my strong coding knowledge to guide others effectively. I enjoy exploring new technologies and programming trends, but I also take pride in being able to manage projects and support my teammates. For example, when working on a complex development task, I can clarify concepts and provide assistance to colleagues who may be struggling with certain aspects of the code. This ability to break down complex problems and share insights helps the entire team stay aligned and productive. I confirmed my skills in this domain in the last SAE of the 2nd semester : I guided the team in the tasks to be accomplished at the code level to move forward as best and as quickly as possible based on each person's skills

I perceive myself as an ingenious and intelligent individual, often coming up with creative solutions to problems. I tend to be introverted, preferring to work independently and process thoughts internally before sharing them. While I see myself as calm, logical, and patient, I don't often express these traits openly to others. Interestingly, my peers seem to have a broader and more positive perception of me than I initially realized. They see me as helpful and friendly, traits I hadn't considered prominent in my personality. They also view me as independent and constantly searching for knowledge, which aligns with my self-perception of being intelligent. I'm surprised to learn that others find me trustworthy, organized, and able, as these are qualities I don't often acknowledge in myself. It's intriguing to note that some see me as both relaxed and nervous, perhaps picking up on internal conflicts I'm not fully aware of. The fact that others perceive me as complex suggests that there may be more layers to my personality than I recognize. This exercise has been eye-opening, revealing that I might underestimate my positive impact on others and that there are aspects of my personality, both positive and potentially challenging, that I'm not fully aware of.

Participating in these "speed dating" style interviews allowed me to improve both as a candidate and as a recruiter. I became more confident with each session, and it became increasingly easy to showcase my skills. Initially, the questions were often along the lines of "Who are you?" to learn more about the person, while later questions focused on "What are your skills, passions, and qualities?" to assess if the candidate matched our needs. As a recruiter, I started to feel more comfortable asking targeted and relevant questions, but I found the process to be long and repetitive, as the same questions came up regularly. Ultimately, this exercise allowed me to improve my listening and evaluation skills, as well as my ability to speak in English.

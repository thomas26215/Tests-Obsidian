# Simple charts
## Infographs
text = most representating.
Icons great to emphasize data
Combinaison keys figures and icons, good infographics

keys-digits also good
everyone can make good infograph

## Table
Accessible to everyone
Use everyday. Graphs, tables presentating dats
Datas good and clean. Sort. Simplify datas.
Remove gridlines
Left aline text and right align numbers. Align titles with datas. Resize columns.
Add separators. Round the numbers. More accessible. Bold title, important infos.

## diff horizontal and vertical charts
Vertical = time series (years, months ...)
0 to 17, 7 to 5 .. ordinal variables. Not impossible to horizontal, but easier to read in vertical

Horizontal = longs category(country ...)

## What a good vartical bar chart ?
1. Label
2. Sources (where we takes the information)
3. Always start axes at 0 (x=0 et y=0)
4. M, B (10M, 4k)

## Horizontal
1. Avoid use achronyms

Stacked bar chart = compare totals and  be able to see their breakdowns
1. .
2. Legend
More than 2 categories = hard to understand. Can be done, but not perfect
avoid using acronym

## 100% stacked batr chart
Represent % of compleat (ex → 100%)
...

## Line charts
Commonly use to show trends. Use natural increments diveided by 3, 5 or 10 ...
Don't show to many points

### Multiple lines
No more than 4  lines
1 line for other (other regions ...)
diffrents colors. Distinct to better recognise lines

More than 4 lines, focus on 1 serie. Highligh. 4 lines not a rule to not break

Break down into small charts. Sort the datas (alphabetic ...)

## Pie charts
Popular choice but not optimal. Lot of space to show little information. Quite difficult to compare size and limited space for direct labelling ⇒ Legend

1. Merge small categories into other for better visualisation. Sort from biggest to smallest.

Not 3d and not multiple  piecharts

Donuts datas good for binary datas


# Advances charts
## surface area
use for communication purpose only

## Bubble charts
Good for visualisation of multiple variables. Differents size for bubbles, differents colors

## Matrix
Large dataset in a condensed space

## Visualisation
### décision tree
details, look more closely
